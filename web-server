Client server relationship: The client accesses the server via its address and requests. Specific requests deliver specific responses. 
One might need data, or to delete data for example. An API is the interface linking the two.


The request / response cycle is asynchronous. Meaning there is an unknown amount of time that will pass in between the request and the response. 
The request needs to be formatted according to the API and the query parametes it has set. Assuming the client has done so coorectly, and submits a request 
then the server will execute the desired action. The client is given a code notifying it if the request was succesful (200's) or not (400's).
If the client requested data, that will also be included in the response.
